Big Ideas.
As the creative powerhouse behind Reuters and Reuters.tv, I never stop dreaming of killer features two days before launch.

Tastemaker.
Years of British schooling have given me a keen eye for fashion and design. I’ve been awarded  “best dressed” on The Hub™ in 2013 and 2014.

Influencer.
In my travels as a marketing guru I’ve made some friends in high places. This is me with Kim Kardashian, right before her bouncer forcibly removed me from the venue.
